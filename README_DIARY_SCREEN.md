## ðŸŽ¯ Sample Data

### Mock Notes Included
1. **"Mode changing"** - Today, 1 hour ago

3. **"Headache"** - Today, 5 hours ago
4. **"Paining Head"** - 17th Aug, 2 hours ago

### Data Structure
```kotlin
data class DiaryNote(
    val id: String,
    val title: String,
    val content: String,
    val timestamp: LocalDateTime
)
```

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation

### Swipe-to-Delete
- Uses Material 3 `SwipeToDismissBox`
- Custom background with Edit/Delete buttons

- Swipe gestures work immediately

## ðŸ“‹ Future API Integration

### Ready for Backend
- `DiaryNote` data class ready for JSON serialization
- Sample data easily replaceable with API calls
- State management prepared for real-time updates
- CRUD operations structured for API integration

### Planned Enhancements
